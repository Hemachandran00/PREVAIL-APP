# PREVAIL-APP

PREVAIL is an initiative by a group of engineering students from Sri Sairam Engineering College, Chennai which is based on the idealogy of "India fights Corona". Feeling sick? Skeptical about affected by corona? Don't worry, PREVAIL helps you contact a doctor bot or the government helpline numbers which elucidate your current health status. 
 
The app provides detailed statistics on the currently active, recovered, and death cases in India and also at a regional level (top 5 states that are most infected) in an intuitive UI, which makes it to apparent to any user. The PREVAIL team believes in “To us, all towns are one, all men our kin”, and so we help in forming an open community (PREVAIL COMMUNITY) in which anyone could be a 
volunteer (GUARDIAN) and also individuals in need of help. Users can post their needs under four category Medical, Food, Shelter and Other. Whatever may be your need we got your back and together we can PREVAIL this current crisis.#staysafe #stayhome
